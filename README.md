BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

Unless you have a really nice PC this will likely run very poorly in the emulator, so please make sure you have an Android device.

* First you need the android SDK. You can get it here:
  http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
  Download the correct one for your system.

* This guide is very detailed about how to set things up:
  http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html
  Make sure you follow steps 1-4 carefully as they are the most important.

* Import the project into Eclipse.
  File->Import General->"Existing Projects Into Workspace"
  
* At this point you should be able to build (Run -> Run).
